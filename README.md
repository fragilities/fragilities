# fragilities
My repo for taking coding challenges for learning purpose.

Some algorithm might be original (probably not considering the number of coder/learner in this world), or some of them might be partly similar from what you can see on the internet. However, I always attempt to edit the logic and or add some feature.

My current main language is javascript.
